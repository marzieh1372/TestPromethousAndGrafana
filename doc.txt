called attributes. Each of these labels represents a particular metric
and the attribute provides you with a way to query so that you can get the values.


## Docker-Compose file
###Promethous
Here, we have the config file mounted at the location /etc/prometheus and we use the location of
the config file as an argument to the command. For simplicity, we are using the host network mode,
so that Prometheus can access our application endpoint directly.
With this, let’s start the docker image with docker compose up and open the URL http://localhost:9090 on our browser.

## Alerts
With Prometheus, we have the possibility to get notified when metrics have reached a certain point,
which we can declare in the .rules files. Prometheus has a component which is called the “Alertmanager”,
and it can send notifications over various channels like emails, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.
